# foobar
Some solutions to Google's "secret" coding challenge, called Foobar.

I got through six challenges before my semester's classes took over most of my time. Admittedly, I was probably not going to solve the sixth one anyway.
I didn't save my code for the first problem (it was the simplest one, anyway). Here are the rest - 

1) Knight Moves:
Given a source and a desintation of integers 0-63, representing the squares on a chess board, this code outputs the minimum number of knight moves to go from source to destination.

2) Bombs:
You have two different kinds of bombs, represented as (1, 1). At each 'step' you can add one number to the other to increase your total bombs – so at step 1 you could have (1, 2) or (2, 1). This code outputs the number of steps to reach some configuration (x, y) bombs.

3) Shortest path:
Given a matrix of 1's 0's this will output the length of the shortest path from the top left to the bottom right. 1's are walls which cannot be passed through, but the code allows for one wall to be knocked down.

4) Codes:
Counts the number of lucky triples in a given array. A lucky triple is some (x, y, z) such that x divides y, y divides z, and their indices are strictly increasing.

5) Cycle:
Checks for a cycle given a string of numbers...I've lost the specification of Google's problem here (that is, how the string of numbers was manipulated each step to become a new string...), but it would be an interesting task to try to figure it out given this code, which I know is correct.
